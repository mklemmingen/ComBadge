- **Authorization Bypass**: Accessing resources without permission
- **Data Exposure**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data

### Medium Priority

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Client-side injection attacks
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Unauthorized state changes
- **Information Disclosure**: Leaking sensitive information
- **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion attacks
- **Session Management**: Session fixation or hijacking

### Lower Priority

- **Rate Limiting Bypass**: Circumventing rate limits
- **Input Validation Issues**: Non-exploitable validation problems
- **Configuration Issues**: Insecure default configurations
