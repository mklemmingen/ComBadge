- Downloading AI models (HTTPS)
- Local Ollama API (localhost:11434)

## Troubleshooting

### Setup Wizard Doesn't Appear

If the wizard doesn't appear but ComBadge isn't working:

1. **Manual Ollama Check:**
   ```bash
   ollama --version
   ```

2. **Manual Model Check:**
   ```bash
   ollama list
   ```

3. **Reset Setup State:**
   Delete `~/.combadge/setup_state.json` and restart ComBadge

### Download Interrupted

The setup wizard automatically resumes interrupted downloads:
- Progress is saved
- Partial downloads are retained
- Simply restart ComBadge to continue

### Installation Fails

Common issues and solutions:

**"Administrator privileges required"**
- Right-click ComBadge.exe â†’ "Run as Administrator"

**"Insufficient disk space"**
- Ensure 10GB+ free space
- Check both system drive and user profile drive

**"Network error downloading"**
- Check internet connection
- Verify firewall/proxy settings
- Try manual download from https://ollama.ai

### Slow Download Speed

To improve download speed:
1. Close bandwidth-intensive applications
2. Use wired connection if possible
3. Download during off-peak hours
4. Consider manual model download:
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen2.5:14b
   ```

## Manual Setup (Advanced)

If automatic setup fails, you can install manually:

### 1. Install Ollama
```bash
# Windows
winget install ollama

# or download from
https://ollama.ai/download
```

### 2. Start Ollama Service
```bash
ollama serve
```

### 3. Download Model
```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:14b
```

### 4. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check service
curl http://localhost:11434/api/version

# Check model
ollama list
```

## Privacy and Security

During setup:

The setup wizard only:
