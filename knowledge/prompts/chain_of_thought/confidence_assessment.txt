- Considers entity completeness, validation success, and format consistency
- Accounts for missing information and entity relationship consistency

**3. Business Rule Compliance Confidence (20% of total)**
- Measures confidence in policy adherence and constraint satisfaction
- Includes authorization verification, resource availability, and approval requirements
- Considers regulatory compliance and safety requirement validation

**4. API Mapping Confidence (15% of total)**
- Measures accuracy of translating request to appropriate API operations
- Based on endpoint selection, parameter mapping, and data transformation accuracy
- Includes error handling and fallback option availability

**5. Resource Availability Confidence (15% of total)**
- Measures confidence in resource allocation and scheduling feasibility
- Considers vehicle availability, facility capacity, and personnel scheduling
- Accounts for conflict detection and alternative resource options

**6. Context and History Confidence (5% of total)**

### CONFIDENCE CALCULATION FORMULA

```
OVERALL_CONFIDENCE = (
    (INTENT_CONFIDENCE × 0.25) +
    (ENTITY_CONFIDENCE × 0.20) +
    (BUSINESS_RULE_CONFIDENCE × 0.20) +
    (API_MAPPING_CONFIDENCE × 0.15) +
    (RESOURCE_CONFIDENCE × 0.15) +
    (CONTEXT_CONFIDENCE × 0.05)
) × COMPLEXITY_FACTOR × SAFETY_FACTOR
```

**Complexity Factor:** 0.8-1.0 (reduces confidence for complex multi-step operations)
**Safety Factor:** 0.7-1.0 (reduces confidence for safety-critical operations requiring human oversight)

- Low-risk, routine operations with high confidence
- Standard fleet management operations
- Adequate error handling and rollback capabilities

**Human Review Threshold (0.70-0.84):**
- Operations requiring confirmation before execution
- Medium-risk operations or operations affecting multiple resources
- Operations with moderate business or safety impact
- Operations involving significant resource allocation

**Clarification Required Threshold (0.50-0.69):**
- Operations requiring additional information before proceeding  
- High uncertainty in intent, entities, or business rules
- Operations with potential significant impact if misunderstood
- Complex multi-step operations with coordination requirements

**Escalation Required Threshold (Below 0.50):**
- Operations requiring human intervention or escalation
- Very unclear requests or operations outside normal parameters
- Safety-critical operations with insufficient confidence
- Operations involving regulatory compliance or legal implications

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC CONFIDENCE ADJUSTMENTS

**Safety-Critical Operations:**
```
SAFETY FACTOR APPLICATION:
- Emergency maintenance: Confidence × 0.8 (requires human oversight)

```
FINANCIAL IMPACT ADJUSTMENTS:
- Operations over $1000: Confidence × 0.9
- Operations over $5000: Confidence × 0.8  
- Operations over $10000: Confidence × 0.7
- Emergency operations: May override financial thresholds

APPROVAL INTEGRATION:
- Confidence calculations include approval probability
- Operations requiring multiple approvals get reduced confidence
- Pre-approved operations get confidence boost
```

**Regulatory and Compliance Operations:**
```
COMPLIANCE FACTOR APPLICATION:
