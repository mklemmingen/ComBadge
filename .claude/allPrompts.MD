src/combadge/ui/components/error_dialog.py  # User error interface
```

ERROR CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM:
```python
class ErrorCategory(Enum):
    # LLM Related Errors
    MODEL_LOADING_FAILED = "model_loading_failed"
    MODEL_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT = "model_response_timeout"
    MODEL_PROCESSING_ERROR = "model_processing_error"
    
    # API Related Errors
    API_CONNECTION_FAILED = "api_connection_failed"
    API_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED = "api_authentication_failed"
